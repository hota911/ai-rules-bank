## Testing Guidelines

- Remember the Google testing blog advice: ["Don't Put Logic in Test Helpers"](https://testing.googleblog.com/2014/07/testing-on-toilet-dont-put-logic-in.html)
  - Test helper methods should be simple and straightforward
  - Avoid complex logic or calculations within test helper functions
  - Keep test helpers focused on setup, teardown, and basic test support
